1.  Native American NCLB math test results.  This would focus on one assessment maybe in comparison to other minority groups in 8th grade.

This could also focus on comparison by Socio economic status. Also number of students on free or reduced lunch 
2.  Math NCLB test results by population of town/city  This would focus on 1 state and one assessment for 3rd or 8th grade

This could benefit from comparison by Socio econimic status. Also number of students on free or reduced lunch

Suggested modificications to assignment 1
consider adding some information on socio economic status of students
-how many of this students are on free and reduced lunch program?
